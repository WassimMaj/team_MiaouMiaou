1. Introduction:
Today, Wikipedia is part of everybody's life. It is the first source that most people will check when they want to get information. This website is maintained by volunteers through open collaboration, and what makes its strength, can also bring problems. Wikipedia aims to have a neutral point of view and stay strictly factual but can we garantee this when anyone can become a contributor ? (Das & Lavoie, 2016) observed that a large number of Wikipedia editors change their behaviour and focus on editing controversial topics when promoted to administrators, they might be biased (consciously or not) and influence these articles. Our study aims to examine the political bias within Wikipedia and its potential impact on Wikispeedia players, a game where participants try to navigate to a specific article solely using hyperlinks within the current article. This game aims to characterize semantic distances between concepts (West et al., 2009). This will allow us to see if this semantic distance is influenced by bias.

2. What about Political bias and political figures in wikispeedia ?

Firstly, let's define a political bias : this refers to a tendency to orient or modify information to make a political position more attractive.
To define that, plain text of the articles was assessed in relation to two other well-known sites that reproduce wikipedia in their own way: [Rationalwiki](https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Main_Page) for the left wing and Infogalactic for the right wing. After training a machine learning model (BERT with SVM) on these data, wikispeedia articles are used to define the bias they contain. The results are shown below: 
inclure plot camembert ‚Äòpolitical biais repartition‚Äô (2.a.1)
We can see that most of articles in wikispeedia are similar to Infogalactic and then classified as right wing. 

With this we can see if there is some category in wikispeedia that might be more biased in a way than other.

Can we conclude something with this graph ?

Then, we defined the political parties of the political figures present in the wikispeedia game.

Having explored the political biases in Wikispeedia articles, we now understand that these biases might permeate the content we consume daily. This raises a crucial question: How do these biases translate into interactive online environments, specifically in games like Wikispeedia? In the next section, we delve into the Wikispeedia Analysis to investigate whether the potential biases in Wikipedia articles affect the way players navigate through this game.
