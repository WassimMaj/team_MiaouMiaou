Today, Wikipedia is part of everybody's life. It is the first source that most people will check when they want to get information. This website is maintained by volunteers through open collaboration, and what makes its strength, can also bring problems. Wikipedia aims to have a neutral point of view and stay strictly factual but can we garantee this when anyone can become a contributor ? (Das & Lavoie, 2016) observed that a large number of Wikipedia editors change their behaviour and focus on editing controversial topics when promoted to administrators, they might be biased (consciously or not) and influence these articles. Our study aims to examine the political bias within Wikipedia and its potential impact on Wikispeedia players, a game where participants try to navigate to a specific article solely using hyperlinks within the current article. This game aims to characterize semantic distances between concepts (West et al., 2009). This will allow us to see if this semantic distance is influenced by bias.
